## Hi there 👋

Maybe you are interested in knowing more about what I'm sharing here on GitHub, so I put together a list of links to some of my public repositories.

It's a bit more organized than just browsing on the Repositories page 😄

## For fun projects 🎮

- [iCloud-Album-Downloader](/cvscarlos/iCloud-Album-Downloader) A web app for downloading photos from public shared iCloud albums.

## Open Source for [VTEX](https://vtex.com/) Plataform 🛍️

A few years ago, while working in the VTEX environment, I open-sourced some plugins that we used during our development process.

The code is now outdated and the repositories haven't received updates for a long time. However, before judging the code, please consider that we had to support Internet Explorer 6 back then 😅

I'm still interested in developing for VTEX. If you would like to contribute something open-source for VTEX, please contact me by opening an issue in any repository.

**Repositories list:**
- [QD-Infinity-Scroll](/cvscarlos/QD-Infinity-Scroll): a jQuery plugin to automatically load the next page when scrolling down on pages with pagination;
- [VTEX-Cores-Prateleira](/cvscarlos/VTEX-Cores-Prateleira): a jQuery plugin that displays all SKUs of a product on the shelf and makes it interactive;
- [VTEX-Smart-Research](/cvscarlos/VTEX-Smart-Research): a jQuery plugin that enhances the search filter, making it more powerful and easy to use;
- [VTEX-Smart-Menu](/cvscarlos/VTEX-Smart-Menu): a jQuery plugin that extends the VTEX menu with dynamic content, banners, and more;
- [VTEX-Smart-Cart](/cvscarlos/VTEX-Smart-Cart): a jQuery plugin that adds the cart preview feature to VTEX stores;
- [VTEX-Count-Down](/cvscarlos/VTEX-Count-Down): a jQuery plugin that adds a countdown to discounts that have a limited time.
