## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Maybe you are interested in knowing more about what I'm sharing here on GitHub, so I put together a list of links to some of my public repositories.

It's a bit more organized than just browsing on the Repositories page ðŸ˜„

## Projects for fun

- [Wordpress Flickr Theme](https://github.com/cvscarlos/Wordpress-Flickr-Theme): a Wordpress theme for Flickr photographers;
- [VakaPHP](https://github.com/cvscarlos/VaKaPHP): a long time ago, I decided to create my own PHP framework;
- [jQuery Keyboard Code](https://github.com/cvscarlos/jQuery-Keyboard-Code): a jQuery plugin that calls a function when the Konami Code is typed or any other set key sequence;

## Open Source contributions

- [easyselectbox](https://github.com/kosinix/easyselectbox/pull/1): added support for a callback function triggered on "change" event in selectbox HTML element;
- [lz string php](https://github.com/nullpunkt/lz-string-php/pull/21): fixed the call for a class static method on PHP 5.3.

## Open Source for [VTEX](https://vtex.com/) Plataform

A few years ago, while working in the VTEX environment, I open-sourced some plugins that we used during our development process.

The code is now outdated and the repositories haven't received updates for a long time. However, before judging the code, please consider that we had to support Internet Explorer 6 back then ðŸ˜…

I'm still interested in developing for VTEX. If you would like to contribute something open-source for VTEX, please contact me by opening an issue in any repository.
